= Release process

Everything is manual at the moment.

. Make sure the git local repository is clean (ie. nothing listed with `git status`).
. Change the following files:
.. `CHANGELOG.adoc` with an added section (`==`) titled with the release number, with a list of novelties and with a list of contributors.
.. `src/main/kotlin/bandcampcollectiondownloader/Constants.kt` with a new version number.
. Make a commit with both files and with the new version number:
+
```
git add CHANGELOG.adoc src/main/kotlin/bandcampcollectiondownloader/Constants.kt
git commit -m "Release vXXXX"
```
+
. Add a tag with the new version number:
+
```
git tag vXXXX
```
+
. Push everything to the remote git repository, including the new tag:
```
git push --tags
```

And done! ðŸŽ‰
